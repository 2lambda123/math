# Contributor and Maintainer Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Assuming positive intent from maintainers and fellow contributors

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

In general, please be friendly. Showing courtesy and respect to others is a vital part of the Stan's culture, and we strongly encourage everyone participating in Stan development to join us in accepting nothing less. Of course, being courteous is not the same as failing to constructively disagree with each other, but it does mean that we should be respectful of each other when enumerating the 42 technical reasons that a particular proposal may not be the best choice. There's never a reason to be antagonistic or dismissive toward anyone who is sincerely trying to contribute to a discussion.

Sure, Statistical modeling is serious business and all that, but it's also a lot of fun. Let's keep it that way!

As always, discuss Stan development in the Stan [discourse forum](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/). You don't have to actually submit code in order to sign up. Your participation itself is a valuable contribution!

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Conflict Resolution

Conflicts in an open source project can take many forms, from someone having a bad day and using harsh and hurtful language in the issue queue, to more serious instances such as sexist/racist statements or threats of violence, and everything in between.

If the behavior is threatening or harassing, or for other reasons requires immediate escalation, please see the section on enforcement for escalating the issue.

However, for the vast majority of issues, we aim to empower individuals to first resolve conflicts themselves, asking for help when needed, and only after that fails to escalate further. This approach gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute.

If you are experiencing or witnessing conflict, we ask you to use the following escalation strategy to address the conflict:

1.  Address the perceived conflict directly with those involved, preferably in a
    real-time medium.
2.  If this fails, get a third party (e.g. a mutual friend, and/or someone with
    background on the issue, but not involved in the conflict) to intercede.
3.  If you are still unable to resolve the conflict, and you believe it rises to
    harassment or another code of conduct violation, report it.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when
an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.
Examples of representing a project or community include using an official
project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting
as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of
a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the Stan Governing Body at board@mc-stan.org. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

If the Project Stewards receive a report alleging a violation of the Code of Conduct, the Project Stewards will notify the accused of the report, and provide them an opportunity to discuss the report before a sanction is issued. The Project Stewards will do their utmost to keep the reporter anonymous. If the act is ongoing (such as someone engaging in harassment), or involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of violence), the Project Stewards may issue sanctions without notice.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
