  \Stan is a general-purpose probabilistic modeling framework designed
  to support full Bayesian inference.  This document describes \Stan's
  modeling language for specifying the joint probability of observed
  data and unobserved parameters.  \Stan's compiler parses model
  specifications and generates \Cpp code.  \Stan's modeling language
  is based on \BUGS and \JAGS, and like them, allows users to develop,
  fit, and evaluate Bayesian models without knowing \Cpp.

  \Stan performs inference by Markov chain Monte Carlo (\MCMC)
  sampling of parameter values from the posterior distribution of
  parameters given the observed data.  \Stan employs the no-U-turn
  sampler (\NUTS), an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (\HMC)
  that alleviates the need for user tuning of \HMC's rather sensitive
  parameters.  By making effective use of the gradient of the log
  posterior, \HMC converges and explores the parameter distribution
  faster than Gibbs sampling or random-walk Metropolis-Hastings.  The
  improved sampling algorithm and more compact and efficient compiled
  code allows \Stan to operate on data of larger scales and models of
  more complex structure than \BUGS or \JAGS.
