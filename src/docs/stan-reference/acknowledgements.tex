We thank Columbia University along with the Departments of
Statistics and Political Science, the Applied Statistics Center, the
Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy ({\sc iserp}),
and the Core Research Computing Facility.

\section*{Grants}

\Stan was supported in part by a grant from the U.~S.\ Department of
Energy ({\small DE-SC0002099}). The high-performance computing
facility on which we ran evaluations was made possible through an NIH
Research Facility Improvement Grant ({\small 1G20RR030893-01}).


\section*{Individuals}

We thank Michael Betancourt for hanging out at our meetings and
sharing his insights into differential geometry, John Salvatier for
pointing us to automatic differentiation and \HMC in the first place,
and Kristen van Leuven of {\sc iserp} for help preparing our grant
proposals.
