\chapter{Contributed Modules}

\noindent
Stan is an open-source project and welcomes user contributions.  

In order to reduce maintenance on the main trunk of Stan development
and to allow developer-specified licenses, contributed Stan modules
are not distributed as part of Stan itself.


\section{Contributed Modules on GitHub}

The \code{stan-dev} organization on GitHub hosts contributed
projects on GitHub.  This is where the Stan developers themselves will
host works in progress.   The full list of contributed projects is
available at the following location.

Each contributed module on \code{stan-dev}'s GitHub space comes with
its own documentation, indexed by the \code{README.md} file displayed
on GitHub.

Each contributed module has its own licensing the terms of which are
controlled by its developers.  The license for a contributed package
and its dependencies can be found in a top-level directory
\code{licenses/}.
